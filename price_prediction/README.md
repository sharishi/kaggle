# House Price Prediction
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features of the properties.
The dataset used in this project includes both numerical and categorical attributes that
influence house prices. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis,
and the development of predictive models using regression techniques.

### Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate regression models to predict house
prices. 

### Key steps include:

1. Data Loading: Importing and inspecting the dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the relationships between features and house prices.
4. Model Building: Training and evaluating different regression models to predict house prices.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error
6. (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.

### Features
1. Numerical Features: These include attributes like the number of bedrooms, square footage, and age of the house.
2. Categorical Features: These include attributes like neighborhood, type of property, and presence of amenities.

### Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
